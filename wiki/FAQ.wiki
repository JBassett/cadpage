#summary Cadpage FAQ

= Breaking News =

= Will this work for Your local department, county, area ? =

    I have started receiving requests asking if this can be used in their area. In most cases yes. All we need are a few sample messages from your dispatch that can be used to write a decoder/parser and to test with. Once that is in hand we can add your locality in and you can give it a try. 

Email at least 5-6 example texts to cadpage@arcolavfd.org please have at least one that is based on an intersection as well as some street addresses. From that we can start the work.

V1.1.7 is out. Suffolk users can now try Cadpage. Please report crashes or issues. We currently only have 2 city codes BRENTW and NBAYSH so all other areas will fail to map. let us know of other city codes.


= Introduction =
This is the FAQ for Cadpage. 

Cadpage was created by Fire/EMS Personnel that wanted a better 
way to get their calls and map them.

= Details =

This reads incoming text messages. If it sees specific keys in the text message it will treat it as a call and present a popup and options. If the popup's are not happening then check that Cadpage is enabled, and that your location is correct.

For this to work you must meet the following two requirements.
 You must get your calls to your phone via text message.


Do you live somewhere else ? Drop us a note and we can adapt this to work for you. Please include 5 or more sample calls and the city zip code that you receive calls in. This helps with writing the parser.
