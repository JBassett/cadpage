This is the FAQ for Cadpage. 

Cadpage was created by Fire/EMS Personnel that wanted a better

For this to work you must meet the following two requirements.
 You must get your calls to your phone via text message.


Do you live somewhere else ? Drop us a note and we can adapt this to work for you. Please include 5 or more sample calls and the city zip code that you receive calls in. This helps with writing the parser.
