= Breaking News =

! Any Non-Loudoun Users will need to change Location in the settings for this to work.

V 1.1.9 should release on 9/9/10 (seems fitting enough)

V 1.1.9 is in the works. A new developer has joined up and now that the base work is stable we are starting to put the ground work in for cleanup and new functionality.
  * Added a feature that should keep the default sms app from receiving messages that cadpage intercepts and acts on.
  * Adding a filter so that we ignore all text messages except those from the address you specify (we will try to have defaults per location as people report them)
  * Removed some bloat in extra language packs and cleared out code we are not using. Removed to previous permissions SMS_Write and Read_Contacts


V 1.1.8 was released to fix some bugs and crashes. 

V1.1.7 is out. Suffolk users can now try Cadpage. Please report crashes or issues. We currently only have 2 city codes BRENTW and NBAYSH so all other areas will fail to map. let us know of other city codes.


= Introduction =
This is the FAQ for Cadpage. 

Cadpage was created by Fire/EMS Personnel that wanted a better 
way to get their calls and map them.

= Details =

This reads incoming text messages. If it sees specific keys in the text message it will treat it as a call and present a popup and options. If the popup's are not happening then check that Cadpage is enabled, and that your location is correct.

For this to work you must meet the following two requirements.
1. You must be located in Loudoun County, VA or Suffolk County, NY
2. You must get your calls to your phone via text message.
   - For Loudoun users you do this by forwarding messages from google mail to your cell phone.

Do you live somewhere else ? Drop us a note and we can adapt this to work for you. Please include 5 or more sample calls and the city zip code that you receive calls in. This helps with writing the parser.
